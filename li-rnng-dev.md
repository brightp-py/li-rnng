        - [x] Replace nonterminals with dummy "AP", "BP", etc.
- [x] Generate "decided" tree to compare others to.
    - [x] Use beam search to create trees from a batch of sentences.

        - [x] Turn trees into something useful.

        - [x] Create new Database object.
- [ ] Compare the modified tree to the decided one.
